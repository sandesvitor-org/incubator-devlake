### Environment Setup

$ yarn
```

#### Start Development Server

```
$ yarn start
```

Server will listen on `http://localhost:4000`

#### Production Build

To Build static and minified production assets to the `dist/` directory.

```
$ yarn build
```

#### TEST / RUN Production Build

```
$ yarn preview
```
